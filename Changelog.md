Change log:

## 0.24.0 - 2023-12-31

- OpenGL:
    - GLRenderAPI.getProcAddress now works, can be provided by user. If not provided, will try to use standard GL library names
    - Support hardware decoder rendering in multiple renderers and multiple threads.
- Vulkan:
    - Support hdr metadata if render context is created in the library via `updateNativeSurface`
    - Support scRGB swapchain
    - Fix invalid framebuffer after resetting render pass(resize error in qmlrhi example).
- Ensure swapchain bufferfs are cleared after stop. Previously only clear once, may result in showing blank image and the last frame repeatly.
- Improve audio/video track switch `Player.setActiveTracks()`, fast and accurate
- Improve (mpegts) program switch `Player.setActiveTracks(MediaType::Unknown, )`, fast and accurate
- If use `updateNativeSurface()`, vo_opaque must be the `surface` parameter.
- VT: Support mpeg4
- AMediaCodec/MediaCodec:
    - property "surface" and "window" to enable tunnel mode, the value is `Surface` jobject and `ANativeWindow*` value string(Previously "surface" value was `ANativeWindow*`).
    - Increase image queue size to reduce acquire errors. max images can be set via decoder property "images=N" or `player.setProperty("video.decoder", "N")`, where N > 1
- Player.record will choose a suitable format if the format guessed from url does not support all codecs. Select correct format for rtmp and rtsp.
- Recorded timestamp is continious and monotonicity by default, required by live streaming. Previous behavior can be enabled by `Player.setProperty("recorder.copyts", "1")`
- Add `MediaEvent{track, "video", "size", {width, height}}` to indicate video track size change, `MediaInfo.video[track].width/height` also change changes
- Improve decoder change event `MediaEvent{track, "decoder.video", decoderName, stream}`, decoderName of hardware decoders is the alias name(e.g. VAAPI), software decoder name is always "FFmpeg". Previously hardware decoderName may be FFmpeg
- Improve packet drop
- iOS: try to load ass.framework and dav1d.framework instead of .dylib
- Subtitle: ignore invalid ass images to fix crash
- Fix crash if audio channels > 8
- Fix thread safe issues for callback setting apis.

    - Fix wrong audio time base of filter output
    - Fix a potential crash in hw decoder copy mode

- Add `VideoStreamInfo.image` as audio cover art image
- Apply rotation in recorded video
- Add `MediaEvent{track, "decoder.video", "size", {width, height}}` indicates video frame size changed, value in MediaInfo is also updated
- Add player.setProperty("avcodec.opt_name", "opt_val") to apply AVCodecContext options. For video only codecs, you can also use player.setProperty("video.decoder", "opt_name=opt_val");
- Do not sync to audio if no audio decoded
- AMediaCodec: add property "name" to force a codec name, e.g. `AMediaCodec:name=c2.android.hevc.decoder`.

## 0.23.0 - 2023-10-31

- HDR
    - Support scRGB, via `player.set(ColorSpaceSCRGB)`, recommended for windows HDR screen, same experience as system player. You can try it in [QtQuick](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-examples/blob/master/Qt/qmlrhi/VideoTextureNodePriv.cpp#L66) app via env var `QSG_RHI_HDR=scrgb`, or in OBS Studio via [the plugin](https://github.com/wang-bin/obs-mdk)
    - Add global option "sdr.white", SDR white level. Default is 203. Can be a different value, e.g. Qt is 100. OBS Studio default is 300 and can be changed by user in settings dialog.
    - Add global option "hdr10.format", Metal only. Metal use rgba16f for HDR10 by default. This can [let QtQuick apps support perfect HDR playback on macOS](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-examples/blob/master/Qt/qmlrhi/VideoTextureNodePriv.cpp)
    - Add ColorSpaceSCRGB, ColorSpaceExtendedLinearDisplayP3
    - Fix linear target trc

For some drivers(intel iHD driver) it's the only 0-copy solution in GLX context because libva-x11 is broken(vaPutSurface error). `VAEntrypointVideoProc` is requred. Recommend to install `intel-media-va-driver-non-free`, because i965 and free iHD driver may lack of `VAEntrypointVideoProc`.

## 0.21.0 - 2023-05-31

- New D3D12 renderer via `D3D12RenderAPI`. Support all decoders. Performance is similar to D3D11. Optimal texture upload for iGPU, env var "GPU_OPTIMAL_UPLOAD=0" can disale optimal upload to compare performance. You can try [Qt6 QML example](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-examples/blob/master/Qt/qmlrhi/VideoTextureNodePub.cpp#L143) or `./glfwplay -d3d12 video_file`.
- D3D11:
    - Texture upload optimize for iGPU on win10. env var "GPU_OPTIMAL_UPLOAD", significantly reduce vram usage, about 50~70%, and even more for compressed textures. Software decoders and built-in hap decoder will benifit from it.
    - Cache shader binaries
    - Fix crash on win7 if default swapchain format is not supported
- DRM Prime:
    - Auto detect external texture requirements via modifiers

- VAAPI:
    - [Support windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/video-acceleration-api-va-api-now-available-on-windows), backend is d3d12 decoder. Currently only supported by D3D12 renderer 0-copy rendering, or use `copy=1` option for other renderers. Requires dlls from https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Direct3D.VideoAccelerationCompatibilityPack can be found by `LoadLibrary()`
    - Fix render error because of drm fd leak
- Raspberry Pi 3/4:
    - Perfectly support h264, hevc hardware decoder and 0-copy rendering in Raspberry Pi OS via `Player.setDecoders(MediaType::Video, {"V4L2M2M","FFmpeg:hwcontext=drm"})`. System ffmpeg is required, MUST delete libffmpeg.so.* in mdk sdk package. May also work with https://github.com/jc-kynesim/rpi-ffmpeg . EGL + OpenGL ES2/3 is recommended by hevc. You can test with `./glfwplay -c:v V4L2M2M,FFmpeg:hwcontext=drm -gl test.mp4`
