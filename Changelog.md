# 0.34.0

- API:
    - Add `VideoFrame.rotation()`
    - Add `VideoFrame.metadata()`. Currently it's only used by exporting frame SEI, see [this feature request](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-sdk/issues/323)
    - Add `Player.setAudioMix()`
- Add [rockchip decoder](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-rockchip) as a plugin, libmdk-rockchip.so from sdk is required(will be copied automatically if use FindMDK.cmake). `setDeoders(MediaType::Video, {"rockchip", "FFmpeg", "dav1d"})` will enable rockchip decoder. [Document](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-sdk/wiki/Decoders#rockchip)
- Decoder plugins are loaded automatically when invoking `setDecoders()`. plugin name is `mdk-$decodename_lowercase`. For example, `SetGlobalOption("plugins", "mdk-braw:mdk-r3d")` is no longer required for BRAW and R3D decoder.
- VT decoder:
    - force prores raw output rgbaf16. Previously the default format is used, which is rgbaf16 on M1, `'b16q'`(a 4 planes bayer format) on M2+, but `'b16q'` is not supported by current renderers.
    - ProRes Raw support scene referred extended linear trc. Now Metal renderer has almost the same result as QuickTime player.
    - Add `scale` property to output a lower resolution, value can be `1`, `1/2`, `1/4` and `1/8`. Decoding speed is higher if resolution is lower. Known used by ProRes and ProRes Raw
- Support apply decoder properties when decoding via `Player.setProperty("video.decoder", "key1=val1:key2=val2")`, and `Player.setProperty("avcodec.$opt", "val")`, for example `VT` and `FFmpeg` decoder `scale` option. Audio is the same.

- CUDA:
    - Use a stream for output

- Rockchip rkmpp decoder 10bit output can be directly imported by EGLImage w/o rga format conversion. Maybe it's the only player supports this feature.
- MFT:
    - Support async and hardware mft via property `hardware=1` or `async=1`, hardware implies async. jpeg and vp8 can be async decoder
    - `hardware` property value can be a vendor name, e.g. `nvidia`, `intel`, `amd`, `qcom`
    - packed yuv format is not preferred
- D3D11:
    - Render target D3D11RenderAPI.rtv can be an array texture. array index starts from 0, and increases if renderVideo() draws a new frame, i.e. returns a new timestamp
    - Expose [IDXSync](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-sdk/wiki/Render-API#idxsync) for user, which can be used to sync between contexts if render decoded dx11 resource from `VideoFrame.get(DX11Resource*)` or encode/process dx11 texture rendered by `renderVideo()`. It's also used internally.

- record() without any decoder will remux the media. steps: `setDecoders(MediaType::Audio/Viedo/Subtitle, {}) => record(file,...) => set(State::Playing) => waitFor(State::Stopped)`
- Fix avfilter processed audio format
- Fix bitmap subtitle display area
- Fix some subtitle crash

## 0.21.0 - 2023-05-31

- New D3D12 renderer via `D3D12RenderAPI`. Support all decoders. Performance is similar to D3D11. Optimal texture upload for iGPU, env var "GPU_OPTIMAL_UPLOAD=0" can disale optimal upload to compare performance. You can try [Qt6 QML example](https://github.com/wang-bin/mdk-examples/blob/master/Qt/qmlrhi/VideoTextureNodePub.cpp#L143) or `./glfwplay -d3d12 video_file`.
